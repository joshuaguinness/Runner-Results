# RunnerResults

Java program created to effectively catologue runners and their statistics. 

Each "runner" is an object of class Runners and has attributes: name, sex, age, time. 

The main program accesses the textfile where the "runners" are stored, imports each runner and their info, and then makes each "runner" and object of class Runners. It then creates an array of Runners objects. The program can then display the database, add, remove, change info, sort, search, and organize. The program can then export the database back to the textfile with all the changes made.
